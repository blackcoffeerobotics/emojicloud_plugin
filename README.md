## Usage

This plugin proves to be very useful for differentiating between multiple pointclouds.

For instance, one can use ðŸ˜Ž to identify a very accurate pointcloud, or use ðŸ’© to identify a pointcloud with a lot of noise.

## Installation

* To build this package independently:

	  catkin build emojicloud_plugin

## Tutorial

Following are the instructions of adding your very own emoji:

* Add your `.png` image rotated clockwise by 90Â° to `shaders/emojis` directory.

* Run the helper script, and input your emoji name and paste your emoji as well:

	  ./helper_script.sh

	Build your package once you've added your set of emojis.
